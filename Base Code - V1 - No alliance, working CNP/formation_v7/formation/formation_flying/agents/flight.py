# =============================================================================
#    In this file the Flight-styleagent is defined.
#
#    Flights have a communication_range that defines the radius in which they 
#    look for their neighbors to negotiate with. They negotiate who to form a 
#    formation with in order to save fuel.  
#    
#    Different negotiation methods can be applied. In the parameter files one 
#    can set 'negototiation_method' which defines which method will be used. 
#    The base model only includes the greedy algorithm.
