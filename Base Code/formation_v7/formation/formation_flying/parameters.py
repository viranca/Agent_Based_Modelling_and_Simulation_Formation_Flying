# In this file one can change the parameters as stated by the exercises. 
# Clarifications of the of the model parameters can be found in the assignment.
#
# Airport and canvas parameters:
# 	n_origin_airports = 20 [-]. Number of randomly generated origin airports.
# 	n_destination_airports = 20 [-]. Number of randomly generated destination airports.
# 	width = 750 [km]. Width of the canvas.
# 	height = 750 [km]. Height of the canvas.
# 	Boundaries of randomly generated airports:
# 	origin_airport_x: [0.01, 0.3]. 
# 	origin_airport_y: [0.01, 0.3].
# 	destination_airport_x: [0.7, 0.99].
# 	destination_airport_y: [0.7, 0.99].
#
# Flight parameters:
# 	n_flights = 50 [-]. Number of aircraft/flights.
# 	departure_window = 3 [s]. 
# 	speed = 0.3 [km/s]. Speed of the aircraft.
# 	communication_range = 200 [km]. Range 
# 	fuel_reduction = 0.75 [-]. When flying in formation, you use 75% of your original fuel consumption.
# 	negotiation_method = 0 [-]. Set which negotiation method to use 
#           (0: greedy algorithm, 1: CNP, 2: English, 3: Vickrey, 4: Japanese).
#
# Simulation parameters:
# 	n_iterations = 1 [-]. Number of simulation runs, used in the batch runner.
